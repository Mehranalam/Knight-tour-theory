The main function of the program receives 3 basic parameters, 
the first one is col or a set of arrays that play the role of chess house, 
and the second one is the starting point of movement in the i-axis, 

and the next parameter is the starting point of the movement of the chess horse in the j-axis, 
the fourth parameter is the number of steps and house Counts the moves of the chess horse. 
This number is 64 on an 8 x 8 page.

(1,1) (2,1) 


The next 2 parameters are the amount of movement of the chess horse in the axes, 
in a way, the most important part, which is the intelligence of the movement of the chess horse.
